    "**Better flux model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical conservation law: $$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "F is the flux and $F = \\rho u$, flux equals density times velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approx linear relation between traffic speed and traffic density\n",
    "$$F(\\rho) = \\rho u_{max} (1 - \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{max}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The flux model meets the two requirements based on a qualitative view of traffic flow that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $u \\rightarrow u_{max}  and  F \\rightarrow when \\rho \\rightarrow 0$\n",
    "2. $u \\rightarrow 0  as  \\rho \\rightarrow \\rho_{max}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to some unrealistic or improbable results.  For example if the traffic speed is a linear funciton of density, then the flux function will be quadratic and the maximum flux will occur when $\\rho^{\\star} = \\rho_{max} /2$ which corresponds to a traffic speed of $u_{max} /2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to find an ideal traffic speed $u^{\\star}$ that corresponds to an ideal traffic density $\\rho^{\\star}$ which results in the maximum traffic flux: $$F_{max} = \\rho^{\\star} u^{\\star}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve the initial flux by using this observation.  We can try to introduce a flux model that is cubic in $\\rho$ instead of quadratic:  $$F(\\rho) = u_{max} \\rho (1 - A \\rho - B \\rho^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This new model still meets the first criterion $F \\rightarrow 0$ when $\\rho \\rightarrow 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can impose the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When $\\rho = \\rho_{max}$ traffic flux goes to zero: $$F(\\rho_{max}) = 0 = u_{max} \\rho_{max} (1 - A \\rho_{max} - B \\rho_{max} ^2 )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximum flux occurs when $\\rho = \\rho^{\\star} and F'(\\rho^{\\star}) = 0$ : $$F'(\\rho^{star}) = 0 = u_{max} ( 1 - 2A \\rho^{\\star} - 3B(\\rho^{\\star})^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $u^{\\star}$ is obtained when $\\rho = \\rho^{\\star}$ : $$u^{\\star} = u_{max} (1 - A \\rho^{\\star} - B (\\rho^{\\star})^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three equations and four unknowns now, but in practice the ideal traffic speed could be obtained for a given road by observations.  Similarly to $u_{max}$ and $\\rho_{max}$ it will be taken as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solving the new flux Equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gotta use Sympy and LaTeX printing."
