Silicon melts at $1414^{\\circ} C$ but the chips should operate at much smaller temps.  The max temp allowed depends on the model and make.  Usually it is somewhere between $60^{\\circ} C$ and $70^{\\circ} C$, but better CPUs are recommended to operate at a max of $80^{\\circ} C$.\n",

The other two edges are touching components that have a const temp of $T = 100^{\\circ} C$ when the machine is operating.  Initially the chip is at room temp $20^{\\circ} C$.  How long does it take for the center of the chip to reach $70^{\\circ} C$?"
