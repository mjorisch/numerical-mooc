    "Removing heat out of microchips is a big issues in the computer industry.  We're at a point where they can't run much faster because they would start failing to to high temp.\n",

    "Gotta look at how heat is dissipated from the chip with a simplified model.  Let's consider the chip as a 2D plate that is $1cm x 1cm$ made of Silicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "$k = 159W/mC$, $c_p = 0.712 * 10^3 J/kgC$, $\\rho = 2329kg/m^3$ and diffusivity $\\alpha \\approx 10^-4 m^2 /rms$.  Silicon melts at $1414^{\\circ} C$ but the chips should operate at much smaller temps.  The max temp allowed depends on the model and make.  Usually it is somewhere between $60^{\\circ} C$ and $70^{\\circ} C$, but better CPUs are recommended to operate at a max of $80^{\\circ} C$.\n",

    "Artificial problem:\n",
    "The chip is in a position where the top and right edges are in contact with insulating material.  The other two edges are touching components that have a const temp of $T = 100^{\\circ} C$ when the machine is operating.  Initially the chip is at room temp $20^{\\circ} C$.  How long does it take for the center of the chip to reach $70^{\\circ} C$?"

In the x direction the discretization uses i to N lines and in the y direction j to N lines.  A given node will have two spatial coordinates and we need two indices for the two lines that intersect at that node."
